Multipart support for cables will be investigated. Absolutely no promises are being made because:
1. Multipart support is somewhat tedious to add
2. External APIs are a gamble to depend upon

## Credits

* **NeoForge** - Thank you to the NeoForged team for developing a great modloader.
* **More Red** - Thanks to Commoble for their work on More Red as a reference for wires.
* **Project Red** - Thanks to MrTJP for a great reference regarding microblocks. Most of the cable code will be based on their work.
* **CBMultipart** - Thank you to ChickenBones, MrTJP, and covers1624 for continued work on microblocks.

## Future

A major goal is to support Fabric in the immediate future. This is seriously important as it provides ultimate freedom to the player to use whichever loader they want. I have full intentions on supporting Fabric once the NeoForge version is complete. I have tested Architectury implementations, and they are promising, however there is still some manual implementation needed for each modloader that meant I would not want to release depending on it just yet.
